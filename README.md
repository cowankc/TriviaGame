This is a Star Wars  trivia game where you can test your knowledge on Star Wars! Press the start button to start the game and get the first question. You will be given four answers to choose from, once you choose an answer the game will tell you if you are correct, or if you are wrong and what the correct answer is. YOu have 10 seconds to answer the question, if you don't answer it in time it will be counted as a wrong answer. The game records the number of correct and wrong answers. There are 15 questions in all, see how many you can get right! Once you finish the game it allows you the option to retry if you'd like. This was a fun javascript project for myself because I got to make it for something I enjoy, Star Wars!
